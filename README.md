# ML-Anti-Swear-Word-API
This is a Machine Learning research project that is aimed to created an Anti swear word API that can be used on game server, discord or chat room management bots, and many other possible usages.
# Languages
This project will be completely coded in Java and Python
# License
MIT
# Algorithm
We will start with KNearestNeighbor and later we might add in more complex and advanced Machine learning algorithm, including deep learning neural networks
# Contribution
Feel free to contribute anything to this project by pull request
# Attention
Here, since it is a research project, I am going to hard code the algorithms, instead of using any existing libraries, unless if the algorithm is too complicate to re-create, which should not be the case unless if the algorithm is a very complex image recognition neural network
